Browsers tend to act like an OS (deep integration with hardware, near-native performance with WebAssembly code, increasingly immersive web applications, etc.).
The Arc browser seems to push the experience a bit further since it offers users the possibility to use the JS runtime (in this case V8) to run scripts in the foreground or the background. Arc calls these UI components/scripts boosts.
More precisely, Arc makes it easy for developers to create programs (extensions, without going through the Chrome Web Store, or through a complex development process) directly implementable by a user on the browser.
To test this, I implemented a small script myself that:
1. Hides the news feed on Youtube/LinkedIn/Twitter
2. Hides the notification badge on the same sites
3. Add a button next to the logo to display these elements if you want
Here is the source code: 

If you want to test the boosts too, write me a DM. I will share with you a link to download this browser in early access. My quota is 5 invitations per week.
